# video-minifier

Makes videos smol (lossless).
Useful when you have to deal with special characters on weird platforms (read: Powershell and Windows have become my arch nemesis').

Give it a source directory with *mp4* files and optionally a destination directory (will use current working directory otherwise) and let it work its magic.
